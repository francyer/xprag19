      The XPRAG.it 2018 Organizing Committee strives to achieve gender balance
      in all aspects of this conference. The Organizing Committee endeavors to
      achieve this balance through equal female and male representation on the
      Program Committee and as session chairs, as well as through invitations to
      high quality speakers of both sexes in line with the gender balance in our
