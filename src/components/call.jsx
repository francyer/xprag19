    <p>
      We invite submissions of abstracts in any area of experimental pragmatics,
      including neuropragmatics, developmental pragmatics, and clinical
      pragmatics. Three types of submission are accepted:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>oral presentation</li>
      <li>poster presentation</li>
      <li>pre-registration poster</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>A novel submission type</h4>
    <p>
      Pre-registration poster is a novel type of submission, offering the
      opportunity to present plans for studies yet to be undertaken, rather than
      work that has been already completed. The aim of pre-registration posters
      is to promote the integrity and the reproducibility of experimental
      research in pragmatics, in the spirit of Open Science (see Tibon et al.
      2018,
      <em> Title TBA: Revising the Abstract Submission Process</em>, Trends
      Cogn. Sci. 22: 4, 271-274). Pre-registration posters will also offer the
      opportunity to receive feedback on early stages of the research, when it
      is most needed. For similar initiatives, see{" "}
